 [Python Data Science Handbook][ba877d23] opens with a chpater on iPython. If you haven't met iPython, it is what the standard Python interpreter needs to be. Magic abounds, both with ease-of-use and iPython's built-in "magic" methods, letting the user take advantage of iPython's out-of-the-box toolset.

Among the goodies:
- tab completion
- history navigation
- reverse search
- extensive help system (why not use '?')

Those familiar with the bash shell will notice some old friends. I think I join others in saying, "It's about time".

I enjoy iPython for the little things that make a workflow, well, _flow_.

iPython can be had for the low, low price of free as a [stand-alone app][6e474d87], or bundled with the [Anaconda][1e77ca34] framework. I chose the latter, as the book will be using several of the other included packages, namely, numpy and sci-kit. More on those later.
Do check out Anacoda: one framework to rule all your scientific computing needs.
