Yes, you read that right. Read it again for good measure. If you are a product of the 90s feel-good, personal-growth-or-die-trying culture, you probably heard
something like this so often it became a tasteless helping of cliche rhetoric.

This bit of editorial side-stepping has its genesis reflecting on [Mark Manson's][a30d6661] brilliantly caustic and embarassingly funny "[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck][227f1d4a]"

For the uninitiated, one of the subtleties of giving no f*cks is that life is full of pain. Recognizing and more importantly accepting this relieves the constant, low-level underlying tension, frees up energy for what you _really_ want to do, and releases you from the desire to control every damn thing. The question Manson poses that spurred this title is: What pain are you willing to sustain? How much are you willing to struggle?

Basically, pain isn't optional. Neither is failure. The built-in inevitability leads to reframing the classic refrain, "What would you do if you could not fail?"

WAKE THE HELL UP! You will fail! It is guaranteed. It is hard-wired into the system of Life on this planet. Moreover, oh horror of horrors, failure is how we learn. Challenge is how we evolve. Suck it up, buttercup and welcome to the human race.

The beauty is in the acknowledgement and acceptance of the reality of this life.
Pain happens. Failure happens.

How much of these two are you willing to accept? What kinds of pain and failure are you willing to accept?
