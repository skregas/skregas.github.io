title: "Not a Review: PDSH Chapter 2: Numpy and 3B1B's Essence of Linear Algebra"
tags: [python, data science, numpy, linear algebra]

Chapter 2 of [Python Data Science Handbook][ba877d23] is all about how to use Numpy to do cool things with large data sets. Many of the library's untilities mirrors what native Python already provides, but do so in a way that maintains efficiency when working with large data sets.

The thing about this book is that it is a topic overview of Numpy and what it can do. It's not a cookbook, or how-to book. Just like, well, everything in life, application, putting it to use, doing it is where it matters. Keep in mind this is really a beginning: getting familiar with Numpy now will smooth out the data science-specific work later on.

The [Essence of Linear Algebra][b6f0dd31] series by
[3Blue1Brown][327c1fea] is forking FANTASTIC!! Watching this, I recalled my struggles with linear algebra way back in college, wondering why I couldn't have material like this back then. What I love about this series is 3B1B's focus on intuition and intuitive, visual understanding of, indeed, the _essence_ of the topic. This isn't some animated onslaught of abstract formule. 3B1B's art is digging into the foundation of what brings about the intuition. At the beginning he says: "I want you to think about this in a way that you feel you could have invented it." Holy shirt!! This isn't just memorizing dry formule in a vaccuum. This is digging into the heart of what mathematics is expressing: how we think about how the world functions.

There's no meaningless babble here: at the end of the series, he illustrates how linear algebra provides a generalized system of thinking, or vector spaces, that can be applied in all sorts of ways. With clarity, alacrity, enthusiasm, obvious passion and dedication, exceptional animations and video editing, this series is not to be missed. Maybe some lightbulbs will finally come on.
