This is primarily for me, reflecting on the journey, and secondarily an ongoing poke in the ribs to not take it all so damn seriously.

Hence the strange title.

Several things you'll see here, mostly in the realm of Computer Science and its weird and wonderful branches
- Learning Data Science and its applications
BIG news nowadays, as I'm sure you're aware. Playing catch-up? I ALWAYS feel that. Interesting? Undoubtedly. 
Even more so with what the future reveals.

- Machine Learning
The robot revolution is upon us, or will be shortly, after this commercial break. The possibilities here are incredible!

- Algorithms and Data Structures
Yes, this seems like old hat, but it's been sitting dusty and unused on the mental shelves. Time to resurrect the old warhorses.


The games are afoot!
