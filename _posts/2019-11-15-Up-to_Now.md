Just like everyone else who writes, well, _anything_, there will come a time where the writing doesn't happen. That exemplifies the last few months. Travelling, new job, conventions, emotional ups and downs, it all adds up to life experience.

My new role is Software Engineer on the Data Science team of a large energy company. The role influenced starting this blog, as the main focus is applied machine learning. One of the main tasks is gathering and comparing activity and incident information across mulitple data sources and extracting relationships.

Panda studies got pushed back, but not general programming. Once a week, I try to complete a coding challenge and complete one project not related to work. This week was a YouTube alarm clock: a basic script taking the wake time from the user, calcuating the elapsed time, then playing a randomly selected video. The video URLS are stored in a text file.

Another big change: shutting off the screens before 9 pm. Huge in terms of sleep quality, energy levels and quality of life in the mornings. Added bonus: forces me to get s**t done while the sun is still up. Getting more challenging as the days get shorter.
