title: Guides for the Way
---

To be clear, the Internet is HUGE. I've come across many, MANY useful pages, blogs, videos, etc. Some are bookmarked, noted, memorised, (has that _ever_ worked?)
and hundreds more have fallen by the wayside.

What is listed here now is a staring point. Good enough to begin

**Learn Data Science for FREE**<br>

There are several good videos by [Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68KSmHePPePCjW4v57VPQg); this one has a great list of free resources to get started and progress
to an intermediate level

**Essence of Neural Networks/Deep Learning**<br>
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw>

Not only this series, but the entire catalog by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) is exemplary. The care, dedication and skill poured into each video
oozes from the screen. In the Machine Learning series, he references some good materials, one of them being a freely available book on machine learning with Python.

**Python Data Science Handbook** <br>
<https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>

Haven't read this; looking forward to it

**EDIT**
Have to put some online courses on this list. Recently ran across the following:
##### On Coursera
[Note: enrollment is free, which starts a 7-day trial. After that, it's pay-to-learn]

[Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)<br>
Of course this needs to be here. I know I need this refresher.

[IBM Data Science Pro Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)<br>
This looks cool. It starts with data science, using Python to do data science, then seques into ML and then into AI further along.<br>

[IBM AI Pro Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-artificial-intelligence)<br>
Yes, this is supported by IBM, using their Watson technology, but it looks like a great topics course in various AI frameworks, tools and techniques.

[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)<br>
Strictly speaking, this is more akin to ML and AI, but it seems the three disciplines are deeply intertwined.


##### On Udacity
(most of these will not be free; rather they are part of what Udactiy calls a "Nanodegree Program")

[Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)<br>

[Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)<br>

[Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)


***
There it is. Go forth and do great things.
