To be clear, the Internet is HUGE. I've come across many, MANY useful pages, blogs, videos, etc. Some are bookmarked, noted, memorized, (has that _ever_ worked?)
and hundreds more have fallen by the wayside.

What is listed here now is a staring point. Good enough to begin

There are several good videos by [Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68KSmHePPePCjW4v57VPQg); this one has a great list of free resources to get started and progress
to an intermediate level

Not only this series, but the enitre catalog by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) is exemplery. The care, dedication and skill poured into each video
oozes from the screen. In the Machine Learning series, he references some good materials, one of them being a freely available book;
on machine learning with Python.

There it is. Go forth and do great things.
